Data Analytics - Research - High-Performance Sports

As a master student at the German Sports University Cologne, I have all the important things that are relevant for the areas mentioned: theoretical knowledge about high-performance sports and scientific work, practical experience and education as well as technical knowledge in handling data.

Studying high-performance sports opened the possibility to do research as an academic assistant in the field of sports informatics and sports game research (https://orcid.org/0009-0009-7931-2579). In addition, I apply the skills I have learned in practice as a Data Analyst at Rot-Weiss Essen.
