For some, math and computer science is the biggest nightmare. 
For me it is daily business, integrated in the areas:

Science - High-Performance Sports - Data Analysis. 

Who is this guy?

A master student at the German Sports University Cologne, who brings all the important things that are needed for it nowadays: 
theoretical knowledge about high-performance sports and scientific work, practical experience and education as well as technical knowledge in handling data. 

Studying high-performance sports opened the possibility to do research as a academic assistant in the field of sports informatics and sports game research. 
In addition, I am now starting my independent work as a data analyst. To follow me on this path, be sure to check out LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com/in/yannikpaul) and Twitter/X (https://twitter.com/ypAnalysis).

Proficient in data processing, analysis, and visualization using Python, R, and Excel, as well as scientific research and writing. UEFA B-Level license holder.
