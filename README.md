# About me

Iâ€™m a researcher and developer working at the intersection of sports science, data analytics, and technology. Iâ€™m passionate about building tools, interfaces, and models that make data more accessible, interpretable, and actionable.

As part of my PhD at the German Sport University Cologne, Iâ€™m building a new machine learning framework for soccer performance analysis, combining data-driven modeling with real-world sports context.
In parallel, I contribute as a Research Associate to the SportVid project â€” a platform for individual and team sport analysis â€” where Iâ€™m primarily responsible for frontend development using modern web technologies.

With an academic background in high-performance sports (BSc & MSc), practical football experience (UEFA B license), and applied analytics work (Rot-Weiss Essen), I bring a rare combination of domain expertise, technical skills, and research mindset.

Interests: ML, AI, data analytics, applied sport informatics, visual interfaces for analysis.
